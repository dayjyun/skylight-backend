# Approach
Effective planning was crucial for the success of the project. While I had a clear vision of the end goal and a starting point, I knew that the journey would be the most 
challenging part. To streamline my thoughts and ideas, I created a Google Doc as a scratch file, allowing me to capture and refine my implementation strategies. It often 
required clarity and restructuring, but the diagram below represents the culmination of the entire thought process. Check out the 
[user Stories](https://github.com/dayjyun/skylight-backend/wiki/SkyLight) for a full list of things to do. While you're at it, sneak in to the [Kanban Board]
(https://github.com/users/dayjyun/projects/8)
to see the entire work structure! 
# ERD
The successful outcome of the project hinged on the central role of the **Flights** model, which served as the driving component connecting all other models. **Flights** played a 
pivotal role, as without them, airports would be abandoned, air travel for users would be impossible, and ticket sales would be nonexistent.

The relationship between **Flights** and **Airports** is uniquely characterized by two one-to-many connections. This design choice preserves a distinct relationship between the 
two 
objects within the same model, ensuring the integrity and coherence of the data.
